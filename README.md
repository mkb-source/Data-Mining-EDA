# Data-Mining-EDA

This project is based on a simple data exploratory analysis on a 
dataset created from surveying University of Tennessee students in 2012. Skills represented in this project include creating subsets, finding the mean of the subsets, creating meaningful visuals, and a word document report on my findings.
